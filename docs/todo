Add some more complex monster behaviour / pathing
  ->Backtrack path and remember it, like before
  ->Go after player accordingly.
  ->Perhaps add more behaviours, e.g. one monster wanders, one follows,
    one follows you the entire map.
  ->Proper monster collision.

  ->Increase something
  ->Has "chages"
